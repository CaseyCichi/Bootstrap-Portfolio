          <p>My name is Casey Poon, and I am currently 20 years old and studying at Miramar College. When I first got out of highschool I had a very different vision of what I wanted versus what I want today. I started studying graphic arts and design and did lots of free lance work including packaging and logo designing.
        </p>

          <p>I took buisness classes for a year and a half, and realized that I really didn't enjoy it. I am currently studying informatics/computer science, and although im only just getting my feet wet, I really enjoy it!

<!-- For the bootstrap assignment, I struggled with using the rows and columns. On all the pages (index, portfolio, and contact) I was unable to get the aside box or the contact box be responsive in the way that it would move next to the main text box. Another thing I had trouble with was how the background was solid white. I tried to remove it through the css, however, nothing I did seemed to change it one bit. The Last thing I struggled with was the portfolio photos and the tags that went along with them. I tried to research how to make the tags stick to the photos by changing them to fixed, absolute and relative but it didn't seem to work when I made the screen responsive, so I just deleted them. I think overall this assignment was very challenging and I wish I were able to try and put more time into it in order to further develop. -->
